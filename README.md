# ProductLandingPage-freeCodeCamp
This project counted toward my Responsive Web Design certification through freeCodeCamp.org. For this project, I built a landing page to market a product of my choice. 

## User Stories: 
<ol>
    <li>Your product landing page should have a header element with a corresponding id="header"</li>
    <li>You can see an image within the header element with a corresponding id="header-img" (A logo would make a good image here)</li>
    <li>Within the #header element, you can see a nav element with a corresponding id="nav-bar"</li>
    <li>You can see at least three clickable elements inside the nav element, each with the class nav-link</li>

    <li>Within the form, there is an input field with id="email" where you can enter an email address</li>
    <li>The #email input field should have placeholder text to let users know what the field is for</li>
    <li>The #email input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address</li>
    <li>Within the form, there is a submit input with a corresponding id="submit"</li>
    <li>When you click the #submit element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit)</li>
    <li>The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport</li>
    <li>Your product landing page should have at least one media query</li>
